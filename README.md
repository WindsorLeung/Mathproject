You’re going to choose one of the dice and then T. Mike will choose one of the other ones. Each of you rolls the dice chosen. If the number you get is bigger, you win, and vice versa.  Which dice will you choose? Is there any ‘best’ dice? Justify your answers using probability or expected values. (You may consider using table, tree diagram or other approaches.) 
Now, three players are playing this game. Each player chooses one of the dice. Getting the biggest number wins the game. Is there any ‘best’ dice? If so, which one is it? Justify your answer using probability or expected values.
